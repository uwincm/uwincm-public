University of Miami Wave Model (UMWM)

Bug fixes and updates since version 1.0.1:

1) Fixed the issue with gfortran where the compiler would
not let the code contain SQRT(-1) as a literal constant (Tim Campbell);

2) Fixed the bug where wavenumber was not stored correcly in 
restart output in MPI mode;

3) Added non-blocking MPI routines in gridded output;

4) Implemented a sequential umwmrst output in MPI mode instead of 
array gathering to root CPU;

5) Fixed a bug in calculation of spectrum peak;

6) Implemented surface Stokes drift velocities in calculation of 
skin drag;

7) Added total momentum diagnostic output in x and y;

8) Added momentum flux components and tail output;

9) Fixed bugs in spectrum output;

10) Added grid curvature field to the output;

11) Corrected the ocean top momentum flux; now momentum fluxes 
are conservative;

12) Added Cg*M to the output;

13) Cleaned-up NetCDF attributes;

14) Fixed a bug in restart_read which caused the model to fail for very large domains;

15) Added intrinsic and total phase and group speeds in the output;

16) Added an option to refine or coarsen the input grid in tools/wrf2umwmgrid;

17) Fixed a bug in advection by currents in UMWM_advection.F90;

18) Upgraded to datetime-fortran library for date and time management;

19) Added time dimension to all fields in the gridded NetCDF output (umwmout);

20) Instead of Cd in restart I/O, using friction velocity ustar;

21) Added explim_ramp in source subroutine in UMWM_physics.F90;

22) Added Stokes e-folding depth to gridded output;

23) Changed the plunging dissipation factor from COTH(kd) to COTH(0.2*kd)

24) Wind speed dependent sheltering coefficient A1 (see UMWM_physics.F90)

25) Updated physics coefficients (see namelist.input)
