\label{field_dictionary}

The NUOPC Layer uses standard metadata on Fields to guide the decision making that is implemented in generic code. The generic {\tt NUOPC\_Connector} component, for instance, uses the {\tt StandardName} Attribute to construct a list of matching Fields between the import and export States. The NUOPC Field Dictionary provides a software implementation of a controlled vocabulary for the {\tt StandardName} Field Attribute. It also associates each registered {\tt StandardName} with {\tt CanonicalUnits}.

The NUOPC Layer provides a number of default entries in the Field Dictionary, shown in the table below. The {\tt StandardName} Attribute of these entries complies with the Climate and Forecast (CF) conventions as documented at \htmladdnormallink{http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/docs/guidelines.html}{http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/docs/guidelines.html}. 

Currently it is common practice that a user of the NUOPC Layer extends the Field Dictionary by calling the {\tt  NUOPC\_FieldDictionaryAddEntry()} interface to add additional entries. It is the intention to increase the number of default entries over time, and to more strongly leverage the NUOPC Field Dictionary as a means to increase the interoperability between codes that use the NUOPC Layer.

Currently the NUOPC Layer uses the {\tt CanonicalUnits} entry to verify that Fields are provided in their canonical units. The plan is to extend support to include unit conversion in the future.
