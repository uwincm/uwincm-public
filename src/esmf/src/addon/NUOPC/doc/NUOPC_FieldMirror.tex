\label{FieldMirror}

In some cases it is helpful for a NUOPC component to automatically mirror or match the set of fields advertised in another component.  One purpose of this is to automatically resolve the import data dependencies of a component, by setting up a component that exactly provides all of the needed fields.  This is currently used in the NUOPC Component Explorer:  when driving a child NUOPC Model with required import fields, the Component Explorer uses the field mirroring capability to advertise in the driver-self export State the exact set of fields advertised in the child NUOPC Model.  This ensures that the entire Initialize Phase Sequence will complete (because all dependencies are satisfied) and all phases can be exercised by the Component Explorer.

The field mirror capability is also useful with NUOPC Mediators since these components often exactly reflect, in separate States, the sets of fields of each of the connected components.  The field mirroring capability, therefore, can be used to ensure that a Mediator is always capable of accepting fields from connected components, and removes the need to specify field lists in multiple places, i.e., both within a set of Model components connected to a Mediator and within the Mediator itself.

The field mirror capability is supported in the Initialize Phase Definition version 5 (IPDv05) and higher, defined in section \ref{IPD}.  During {\tt IPDv05p1}, driver-self, models, mediators, and drivers advertise fields in their import and export States.  At this point, these components can also optionally set the {\tt FieldTransferPolicy} Attribute in their import and export States.  The default value "TransferNone" indicates that no fields should be mirrored.  The other option, "TransferAll", indicates that fields should be mirrored in the State of a connected component.

During {\tt IPDv05p1}, each Connector consider the {\tt FieldTransferPolicy} Attribute on both its import and export States.  If {\em both} States have a {\tt FieldTransferPolicy} of "TransferAll", then fields are transferred between the States in both directions (i.e., import to export and export to import).  The transfer process works as follows:  First, the {\tt TransferOfferGoemObject} attribute is reversed between the providing side and accepting side.  Intuitively, if a field from the providing component is to be mirrored and it can provide its own geometric object, then the mirrored field on the accepting side should be set to accept a geometric object.  Then, the field to be mirrored is advertised in the accepting State using a call to {\tt NUOPC\_Advertise()} such that the mirrored field shares the same Standard Name.

At this point the Initialization Sequence continues as usual.  Since fields to be mirrored have been advertised with matching Standard Names, the field pairing algorithm will now match them in the usual way thereby establishing a connection between the original and mirrored fields.
