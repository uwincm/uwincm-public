\section{Bookeeping Memory Allocation}
%
{\tt m\_mall} is a bookkeeper of user allocated memories.
It performs operations such as checking in and checking out allocated 
activity, generating word count output, searching/inserting a name in a list,
initializing the module data structure, etc.
%
\begin{verbatim}
EXAMPLE:

    . call mall_ci(size(marg),thread)
           is used to check-in the allocated activity.
           "thread" is a chain of characters, and
           "marg" can be an integer, a real, a logical, or a character.

    . call mall_co(size(marg),thread)
           is used to check-in the allocated activity.
\end{verbatim}
