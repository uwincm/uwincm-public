HI, welcome to ESMPy :)

ESMPy is a Python interface to the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) 
regridding utility.  ESMF is software for
building and coupling weather, climate, and related models.  ESMF has a robust,
parallel and scalable remapping package, used to generate remapping weights.
It can handle a wide variety of grids and options:  logically rectangular grids
and unstructured meshes; regional or global grids; 2D or 3D; and pole and
masking options.  ESMF also has capabilities to read grid information
from NetCDF files in a variety of formats, including the evolving Climate and 
Forecast (CF) GridSpec and UGRID conventions.

ESMPy supports a single-tile logically rectangular discretization type called
Grid and an unstructured discretization type called Mesh (ESMF also
supports observational data streams).
ESMPy supports bilinear, finite element patch recovery and first-order
conservative regridding.  There is also an option to ignore unmapped
destination points and mask out points on either the source or destination.
Regridding on the sphere takes place in 3D Cartesian space, so the pole
problem is not an issue as it commonly is with many Earth system grid remapping
softwares.  Grid and Mesh objects can be created in 2D or 3D space, and 3D
first-order conservative regridding is fully supported.  Future plans for ESMPy
involve the incorporation of observational data streams.

Regridding, also called remapping or interpolation, is the process of changing
the grid underneath field data values while preserving the qualities of the
original data.  Different kinds of transformations are appropriate for
different problems. Regridding may be needed when communicating data between
Earth system model components such as land and atmosphere, or between
different data sets to support analysis or visualization.

Regridding can be broken into two stages. The first stage is generation of an
interpolation weight matrix that describes how points in the source grid
contribute to points in the destination grid. The second stage is the
multiplication of values on the source grid by the interpolation weight matrix
to produce the appropriate values on the destination grid.  ESMPy provides
access to both stages through two separate interfaces.

There are many different interpolation methods, suitable for different
problems.  In ESMPy, the basic bilinear option is a two dimensional variant of
linear interpolation.  The higher order patch recovery is a second degree
polynomial regridding method, which uses a least squares algorithm to
calculate the polynomial.  The first-order conservative regridding is a
variant of a constant method which compares the proportions of overlapping
source and destination cells to determine appropriate weights.  All of these
methods can be broken down to a simple sparse matrix multiplication operation
between interpolation weights and data values.

requirements.

The "INSTALLATION" section gives directions on how to install ESMPy.
(If you just downloaded the ESMF tarball, it is source code and you will
have to build the ESMF library first.)

The "USE" section below will give information on how to import this package.

The "VALIDATION" section below will give information on how to test the package.

The "LIMITATIONS" section has helpful information on which capabilities
can be expected from the current ESMPy functionality.

The "MORE HELP" section will give you links to more documentation and other
information about the ESMF project.

Documentation for the ESMPy library can also be found by running 'pydoc ESMF'
from the terminal prompt in the top level ESMPy directory.

================================================================================

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

The following packages are *required* to work with ESMPy:

-- ESMF installation - http://www.earthsystemmodeling.org/esmf_releases/last/ESMF_usrdoc
-- python - http://python.org/
-- numpy - http://numpy.scipy.org/

The following packages are *optional*:

-- mpi4py - python bindings to MPI, needed to run the parallel regridding tests
-- ESMF installation with NetCDF - required to create grids and meshes from file
    - NetCDF must be built as a shared library for ESMPy installation to succeed
-- nose - for nose testing

INSTALLATION:
--------

Installation of ESMPy requires a pointer to a file named esmf.mk inside of an
ESMF installation.  This file resides in a directory which looks like:

<ESMF_INSTALL_DIR>/lib/lib<g<or>O>/<platform>/esmf.mk

If the ESMFMKFILE flag is set when building ESMPy then it will not need to be
referenced again.  If not, an environment variable of the same name must be set
with the path to the esmf.mk file EVERY time that a new shell is initiated.

The ESMPy build can be installed in a custom location using the
--prefix, --home, or --install-base flags to the install command.  If this
is done, then this location needs to be added to the PYTHONPATH environment
variable in the user's shell EVERY time that a new shell is initiated.  If a
customized install location is not specified, ESMPy will be installed in the 
standard Python package installation directory on that particular machine.

Note: The ESMPy build does not have to be installed to be used.  The 
PYTHONPATH environment variable can simply be pointed to the directory 
containing the ESMF module (esmf/src/addon/ESMPy/src from a default git clone) 
after the build command.

As usual, any command followed by --help should print out some information
on what options are available.

An installation of ESMPy in the default location for Python packages can be done 
with the following command issued from the top level ESMPy directory:

- default Python package installation:

    python setup.py build --ESMFMKFILE=<DIR_TO_esmf.mk> install

- custom install location:

    python setup.py build --ESMFMKFILE=<DIR_TO_esmf.mk>

    python setup.py install --prefix=<custom_install_location>

    setenv PYTHONPATH <custom_install_location>/lib/*/site_packages

Please contact esmf_support@list.woc.noaa.gov with any questions or problems.


USE:
----

To use this package in an external program, import it with:

    import ESMF


VALIDATION:
-----------

The setup.py file can be used to run subsets of the tests individually, like this:

    python setup.py test

    python setup.py test_examples

    python setup.py test_regrid_from_file

    python setup.py test_parallel

    python setup.py test_examples_parallel

    python setup.py test_regrid_from_file_parallel

NOTE: The regrid_from_file tests can take up a lot of memory and bandwidth.  
The "test_regrid_from_file_dryrun" command will simply download the test 
files without actually running them (allowing the stress on the machine to
be applied to bandwidth first, and then memory).

Alternatively, if the nose package is available, the tests can be run with:

    nosetests

Individual tests can be run with nose using the following format:

    nosetests <file>:<test>

e.g.  

    nosetests src/ESMF/test/test_api/test_regrid.py:TestRegrid.test_grid_mesh_regrid


================================================================================

LIMITATIONS:
------------

ESMPy doesn't include many aspects of ESMF, including components, array
interfaces, time management, etc.  The limitations listed here are relative
to ESMF offline and integrated regridding capabilities.

- There is no FieldBundle class, only single Fields.
- There is no support for multi-tile Grids.
- ESMPy cannot use an ESMF installation that is built with external LAPACK 
  support.
- Conservative regridding with a source Mesh created from file is not supported,
  because the Mesh cannot retrieve coordinates from the elements.

Testing related:
- Nightly regression testing is limited to a small subset of the ESMF test
  platforms, including Darwin and Linux running gfortran with openMPI.
