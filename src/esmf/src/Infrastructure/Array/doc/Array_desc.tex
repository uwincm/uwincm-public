The Array class is an alternative to the Field class for representing 
distributed, structured data.  Unlike Fields, which are built to carry 
grid coordinate information, Arrays can only carry information about the 
{\it indices} associated with grid cells.  Since they do not have coordinate 
information, Arrays cannot be used to calculate interpolation weights.  
However, if the user can supply interpolation weights, the Array sparse 
matrix multiply operation can be used to apply the weights and transfer 
data to the new grid.  Arrays can also perform redistribution, scatter, 
and gather communication operations.

Like Fields, Arrays can be added to a State and used in inter-Component 
data communications.  Arrays can also be grouped together into ArrayBundles 
so that collective operations can be performed on the whole group.  One 
motivation for this is convenience; another is the ability to schedule 
optimized, collective data transfers.   

From a technical standpoint, the ESMF Array class is an index space 
based, distributed data storage class. It provides DE-local memory allocations 
within DE-centric index regions and defines the relationship to the index 
space described by the ESMF DistGrid. The Array class offers common 
communication patterns within the index space formalism. As part of the ESMF 
index space layer, Array has close relationship to the DistGrid and DELayout 
classes.
