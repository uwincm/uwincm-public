\label{sec:AttPacks}

At this time, all ESMF objects which are enabled to contain Attributes can also contain Attribute packages, which are groupings of individual Attributes.  Every Attribute package is specified by a unique set of identifiers.  These are called the {\bf convention} and {\bf purpose} of the Attribute package, such as "CF" and "General" (see below).  These are used to validate ESMF Attribute packages against existing metadata conventions.  The {\bf attPackInstanceName} can be used to differentiate between Attributes of the same name within a package. 

The user can choose to use an ESMF pre-defined Attribute package, specify their own Attribute package, or add customized Attributes to any of the ESMF pre-defined Attribute packages. Currently, the creation and setting of Attribute packages is quite involved, but future development with IO will allow for a more automated approach to populating Attribute packages from a file.  This is already possible via {\tt ESMF\_AttributeRead()} for the ESMF/CF Attribute packages supplied by ESMF, as well as for custom individual Attributes not in a package.

The standard Attribute packages supplied by ESMF exist for the following ESMF objects:

\begin{itemize}
    \item CplComp
    \item GridComp
    \item State
    \item Field
    \item Array
    \item Grid
\end{itemize}

The packages described in this section are grouped by the ESMF object they apply to. The creation of custom attributes and custom attribute packages is also possible and is discussed in Section \ref{sec:CustomAttPacks}. In some cases it is possible to nest custom packages on top of ESMF packages. Attribute package nesting is described separately in Section \ref{sec:AttPackNesting}.

Some Attributes come with a controlled vocabulary. A controlled vocabulary is a list of options that can be selected as the value of the attribute. The controlled vocabularies listed in this documentation represent those chosen by the community. They are not exhaustive and users may set these Attributes to a different value if they so choose. The primary consequence of doing so is that the resulting output may not be recognized by any of the online tools being developed with respect to this controlled vocabulary.


\subsubsection{Component Attribute packages}
\label{ComponentAttributePackages}

There are many attributes that are used to describe components. There are currently 4 predefined component-level Attribute packages, with sub-packages defined for the 2nd:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) General
    \item Common Information Model (CIM) Main
    \begin{enumerate}

One or more values can be set (via an array) for an attribute name.

\subsubsection{Field Attribute packages}
\label{FieldAttributePackages}

Several standards exist to describe fields. There are currently 4 predefined Field-level Attribute packages:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Common Information Model (CIM) Inputs
    \item Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) General
    \item Climate Forecast (CF) Convention Extended
    \item Climate Forecast (CF) Convention General
\end{enumerate}

    \end{itemize}
    \item Output Options:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item CIM XML
    \end{itemize}
    \item Description: This package is used to describe a simulation and the input (initial and boundary) conditions used in that simulation. It is also used to describe any ancillary data sets that contain input condition variables. This package should not be used to describe the variables in an unconfigured model component. A pre-defined Attribute package for that case will be implemented in a future release of ESMF.  This package nests the ESMF General, CF Extended, and CF General Field packages (below) within it; this is described in Section \ref{sec:AttPackNesting}.  The attribute values within these ESMF and CF nested packages currently appear in the Component Properties section of the CIM output file.  A separate Component Properties package may be developed for this purpose in a future ESMF release.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\tt convention} = "ESMF"
        \item {\tt purpose} = "General"
    \end{itemize}
    \item Includes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item CF Extended

{\bf 3. Climate Forecast (CF) Convention Extended}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Specify with:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\tt convention} = "CF"
        \item {\tt purpose} = "Extended"
    \end{itemize}
    \item Includes:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tab-delimited
        \item Simple XML
        \item CIM XML (when part of the CIM Inputs package)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Description: The CF standard for fields contains an optional standard\_name Attribute. Standard names are controlled vocabularies and not every variable in the earth system sciences contains a standard name. Because of this, ESMF implemented this optional Attribute in its own package. This package nests the CF General package (below) within it; this is described in Section \ref{sec:AttPackNesting}.
\end{itemize}

{\bf 4. Climate Forecast (CF) Convention General}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Specify with:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\tt convention} = "CF"
        \item {\tt purpose} = "General"
    \end{itemize}
    \item Output Options:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tab-delimited
        \item Simple XML
        \item CIM XML (when part of the CIM Inputs package)
    \end{itemize}
    \item  Description: The climate and forecast (CF) convention contains metadata that is designed to promote the processing and sharing of files created with the NetCDF API. The CF conventions are increasingly gaining acceptance and have been adopted by a number of projects and groups as a primary standard. The conventions define metadata that provide a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and the spatial and temporal properties of the data. This enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable, and facilitates building applications with powerful extraction, regridding, and display capabilities. The ESMF CF Attribute package contains the three mandatory Attributes required to describe fields.

    {\tt LongName} & An ad-hoc long descriptive name which may, for example, be used for labeling plots & N/A\\
    {\tt ShortName*}  & The short\_name is technically not part of the CF standard but is commonly the name of the variable on the output file and so is
 distinct from the long\_name & N/A \\
    {\tt Units}  & The value of the units attribute is a string that can be recognized by UNIDATA's Udunits package & N/A\\

\subsubsection{Custom Attribute packages}
\label{sec:CustomAttPacks}

ESMF allows for the creation of custom attribute packages, each of which has a user-defined convention and purpose, as well as a set of user-defined attributes. This can be done to augment one of the pre-defined packages (via package nesting \ref{sec:AttPackNesting}) or to create a suite of attributes unique to the user. A custom attribute package currently outputs only in simple XML format, when used as a stand-alone package (not when used to augment a pre-defined package).  Examples of how to create such custom packages are contained in Sections \ref{ex:AttributePackageEx} and \ref{ex:AttributeCustPackEx}.
