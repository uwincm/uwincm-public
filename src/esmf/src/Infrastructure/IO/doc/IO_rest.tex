Currently a small fraction of the anticipated data formats is implemented by 
ESMF.  The data IO uses NetCDF and MPI\_IO binary formats, and ESMF Attribute
IO uses XML format.  Different libraries are employed for these 
different formats.  In future development, a more centralized IO technique
will likely be defined to provide efficient utilities with a set of standard
APIs that will allow manipulation of multiple standard formats.  Also, the 
ability to automatically detect file formats at runtime will be developed.
