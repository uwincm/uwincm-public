Older Notes:
-----------
Just updated to PIO 1.2.5:
svn checkout http://parallelio.googlecode.com/svn/trunk_tags/pio1_2_5

Older Notes:
-----------
The "./src/Infrastucture/IO/PIO" directory holds a copy of the PIO source files. These source files are based on PIO svn tag pio1_2_0. They were obtained via:

svn checkout http://parallelio.googlecode.com/svn/trunk_tags/pio1_2_0

This release provides functionality to use a disjoint set of mpi tasks for IO, currently this functionality is supported for netcdf backends but not binary.


Older Notes:
-----------
The "./src/Infrastucture/IO/PIO" directory holds a copy of the PIO source files. These source files are based on PIO svn tag pio1_1_1. They were obtained via:

svn checkout http://parallelio.googlecode.com/svn/trunk_tags/pio1_1_1

Important things to note:

- The PIO configure/make system was removed and replaced by a makefile that links into the ESMF build system.

- Currently all modifications are made to the *.F90 files directly, effectively having them drift out of sync with the *.F90.in files.
