\begin{enumerate}

\item{\bf Fields in a FieldBundle reference the same Grid, Mesh, LocStream, or XGrid.}
In order to reduce memory requirements and ensure consistency, the 
Fields within a FieldBundle all reference the same Grid, Mesh, 
LocStream, or XGrid object. This restriction may be relaxed in the future.

\end{enumerate}
