The NUOPC Layer is implemented in Fortran on top of the public ESMF Fortran API.

The NUOPC utility routines form a very straightforward Fortran API, accessible through the {\tt NUOPC} Fortran module. The interfaces only use native Fortran types and public ESMF derived types. In order to access the utility API of the NUOPC Layer, user code must include the following two {\tt use} lines:

\begin{verbatim}
  use ESMF
  use NUOPC
\end{verbatim}
