%\subsection{Design and Implementation Notes}

Internally all route-based communication calls are implemented as sparse matrix multiplications. The precompute step for all of the supported communication methods can be broken up into three steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Construction of the sparse matrix for the specific communication method.
\item Generation of the communication pattern according to the sparse matrix.
\item Encoding of the communication pattern for each participating PET in form of an XXE stream.
\end{enumerate}
