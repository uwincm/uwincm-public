\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}
\label{XGrid:rest}

\item {\bf CAUTION:} Any Grid or Mesh pair picked from the A side and B side of the XGrid 
cannot point to the same Grid or Mesh in memory on a local PET. This prevents Regrid from
selecting the right source and destination grid automatically to calculate the regridding routehandle.
It's okay for the Grid and Mesh to have identical topological and geographical properties as long
as they are stored in different memory.

\end{enumerate}
