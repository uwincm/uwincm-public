Some code in the src and include directories is generated based
on the file config.yaml using a tool called barectf. Barectf
generates C interfaces to write out events in the Common Trace
Format (CTF).  See https://github.com/efficios/barectf/ for
information about installing this tool locally.  It is not needed
unless you change config.yaml.

The generated files are:
src/esmftrc.c
include/esmftrc.h
include/metadata

If the config.yaml file changes, then run the following to
generate the new interfaces.

$ barectf -c src -H include -m include config.yaml

After this, run the following command to generate the file
src/ESMCI_TraceMetadata.C which writes out the metadata
file in the trace output directory at runtime.

$ python gen_trace_metadata.py
